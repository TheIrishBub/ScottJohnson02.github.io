    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Scott Johnson and I am 17 years old. I'm currently a freshman at Thaddeus Stevens enrolled in the CSET program
      (Computer Software Engineering Technology), and when I am finished I am looking to enter into the game industry. My dream job would do work in a group
      of hard-working individuals all focused on acheiving the same goal. Feel free to contact me at: ScottyJohnson002@gmail.com.

          <img src="downloads/Island-Escape.png" alt="screenshot of terminal playing game">
          <p> This is my first game that I ever made in the Unity engine. This project took me about
            1 year of off and on again coding. I used the asset store for the art used
            in the game and some basic scripts. If I were to do it again I would have made my project files more organized.
          </p>

          <h2>Choose Your Own Adventure: Python</h2>
          <img src="downloads/Python.png" alt="screenshot of terminal playing game">
          <p> This is a choose your own adventure game built in python. This was a quick little game to code, but I was able
            to learn a lot about variables and conditionals. If I were to remake this project I would add more options and more interesting
            paths.</p>
